        Number using O5 and O6:                 10
      Number used as Single Port RAM:            0
      Number used as Shift Register:            12
        Number using O6 output only:             4

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          983
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           447 out of     983   45%
    Number with an unused LUT:                 302 out of     983   30%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:         234 out of     983   23%
    Number of unique control sets:              14
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              19 out of  18,224    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
